# AI Testing in Healthcare – Whitepaper

This repository contains the public whitepaper:

**“Introducing AI Testing in Healthcare: Solving QA Challenges with Prompt Engineering”**  
✍️ Author: [Pavan Kumar Pabbisetty](https://github.com/pavankumarinfo)

## 📄 About the Whitepaper

This whitepaper presents a new framework for testing AI systems in healthcare, focusing on:

- Shift-left QA using prompt engineering
- Semantic logging and audit trails for compliance
- Reusable prompt chains with embedded assertions
- AI-driven test case transformation (e.g., JAMA → Python)
- Future direction: ethical AI QA and red-team alignment

## 🔍 Why This Matters

Traditional QA methods fall short for generative AI systems, especially in safety-critical sectors like HealthTech. This paper outlines practical strategies and tools to:

- Improve coverage of AI outputs
- Automate repeatable validation logic
- Support traceability, compliance, and audit-readiness

## 🧭 Future Roadmap

This repository may grow to include:
- Sample diagrams
- Prototypes of `AgentTest`
- Structured logging/test runners
- Prompt chain templates for QA teams


## 🌍 Vision & Alignment

This whitepaper and repository are part of a broader effort to reimagine quality assurance in the age of AI, with a focus on safe and efficient HealthTech systems.

The ideas documented here — such as prompt chaining, AI test automation, semantic logging, and ethical QA simulation — support emerging national goals in digital health, AI governance, and technology innovation.

This work is aligned with international innovation initiatives in:
- ✅ HealthTech safety and compliance
- ✅ AI safety, explainability, and reproducibility
- ✅ Next-generation tools for quality engineering in large language models (LLMs)

I aim to expand this repository with:
- Modular tools like `AgentTest` (prototype-in-progress)
- Public prompt libraries for QA use cases
- Visualizations of semantic QA workflows
- Test conversion helpers (manual → Python)
