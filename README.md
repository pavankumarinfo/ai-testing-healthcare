# AI Testing in Healthcare – Whitepaper

This repository contains the public whitepaper:

**“Introducing AI Testing in Healthcare: Solving QA Challenges with Prompt Engineering”**  
✍️ Author: [Pavan Kumar Pabbisetty](https://github.com/pavankumarinfo)

## 📄 About the Whitepaper

This whitepaper presents a new framework for testing AI systems in healthcare, focusing on:

- Shift-left QA using prompt engineering
- Semantic logging and audit trails for compliance
- Reusable prompt chains with embedded assertions
- AI-driven test case transformation (e.g., JAMA → Python)
- Future direction: ethical AI QA and red-team alignment

## 🔍 Why This Matters

Traditional QA methods fall short for generative AI systems, especially in safety-critical sectors like HealthTech. This paper outlines practical strategies and tools to:

- Improve coverage of AI outputs
- Automate repeatable validation logic
- Support traceability, compliance, and audit-readiness
