# Prompt Test Flow – Visual Placeholder

This folder will contain diagrams and visual assets related to the whitepaper:
**“Introducing AI Testing in Healthcare: Solving QA Challenges with Prompt Engineering”**

### Planned Diagrams:
- ✅ Prompt Test Lifecycle  
  *Prompt → Assertion Type → Log → Replay*
- ✅ Shift-Left QA for AI Tools in Healthcare  
- ✅ Structured Prompt Chain Flow (modular logic reuse)
- ✅ Semantic Logging Output Format (JSON snapshot)

These diagrams will be published in `.svg` or `.png` format once drafted.

For now, this folder is included to mark future visual content to support the ideas in the whitepaper.
